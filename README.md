# Brainfuck Interpreter
Inspired from <a href="https://copy.sh/brainfuck">El Brainfuck</a>.
<br>
Made purely for fun. Uses Maven and FXML (the interpreter itself does not use FXML).
<br>
The application has 2 entry points (in the 'main' package):
 - InterpreterMain, which runs a program, and prints the time it took and the instruction count (console-based);
 - ApplicationMain, that starts the FXML GUI.
